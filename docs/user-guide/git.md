# Git Collaboration

This is the first time I will be working with other in the same codebase, and thinking about how this actually will work.  This document is a space for us to update how this works best for us.  

## Branches

Currently cleaning up `clean-main` but will probably rename as `development`

## How to work on your own version of the code

There are various options 
* create your own personal branch -- create a pull request in the development branch when your feature is tested
* create a seperate directory called `/sandbox`.  Make certain your `.gitignore` file contains this folder so that it is not committed back to the repo before you are ready.
