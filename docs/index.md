# NanoBot-POC Documentation ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the NanoBot-POC documentation. This site provides comprehensive information about using and extending the NanoBot POC (Proof of Concept) development pipeline.

## What is NanoBot?

NanoBot is a document processing and retrieval system with vector search capabilities. It allows you to:

- Process documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Google Sheets etc)
- Chunk documents into manageable pieces
- Generate vector embeddings
- Store the document data and text in a relational database
- Search documents via a simple chatbot interface

## Purpose of this POC codebase

We are working here to develop a codebase that creates an intuitive pipeline that can be more easily followed, understood and modified by all members involved in the development. The POC component is a robust pipeline that can empower people and orginazitions to generate their very own Bot with their own documentation, enabling them to also demonstrate and understand the power and potential of GenAI in their own labs, facilities and research.

This project presumes that an out-of-the box chatbot developed for you using many onlne WYSIWYG frameworks, is great for concept, but often fails on utility.  By introducing and teaching these concepts in a python codebase framework, we open up the power of Generative AI with only a few custimizations.  

It is our hope by doing so, that we not only create a cohesive codebase with functional code for our respective facilities, but that we are able to bring new menbers on board to help them be able to emply instances of this codebase at their own locations, and that they are also able to contribute themselves in building out this worthwhile effort.  

This building of Code simultaneously builds community, and further collaboration -- this is \(\mathbf{C}^3\)
