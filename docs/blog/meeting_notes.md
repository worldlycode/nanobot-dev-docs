* Sam is using whispr flow, it's like a fancy AI powered voice to text that does a really good job
* Sam has been figuring out how to embedd google docs into mk docs
* Taught someone else to use mkdocs, is there a way to have a lot of documentation in mkdocs, and then have a bot that lives in there
